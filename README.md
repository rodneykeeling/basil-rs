# ðŸŒ¿ basil.rs

`basil` is a personal project to help me grocery shop. It allows me to generate grocery lists based on my most frequently purchased ingredients, as well as ingredients from my favorite recipes, and syncs it to my grocery list on Todoist, all grouped by isle.

Note: this is a tool I use every time I go grocery shopping, but it's also a side-project for my own learning purposes, so over-engineering is expected here.

## Features
- [x] List of all ingredients for one-off selection
- [ ] List of all ingredients for any given recipe
- [ ] Determine amount of ingredients to get (`onion x3`) based on recipe/ingredient selections
- [x] Final grocery list grouped by isle
- [x] Todoist sync
- [ ] A better frontend experience in place of Rust-based templating
- [ ] Ordering: alphabetically, chronologically (most-recently purchased), hierarchically (isle)

## Usage
- `cp env-example .env` and fill in the relevant TODOIST API values
- `docker compose up` to get postgresql running
- `psql -h localhost -d basil -U root -f dump.sql` to import data
- `cargo run` and visit `localhost:3000`
